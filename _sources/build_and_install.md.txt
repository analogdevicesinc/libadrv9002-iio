# Installation

:::{caution}
This library is licensed by a proprietary Analog Devices, Inc. license. By downloading and installing it you agree and accept its terms and conditions. 
:::

**libadrv9002-iio** is provided in binary form only for different architectures and operating systems. We try to cover the majority of options but if you would like an alternative build please reach out to our support. **libiio** variants will be limited since **libiio** and its dependencies do not exist on all possible architectures. The libary is primarily built through use of docker, so if you have an existing image that matches your glibc version you can share, it can make the process of adding new variants faster.

3. Download the DLLs directly and place them with your dependent software.

## Linux

For Linux DEBs and RPMs are provided for debian (and derivatives) and RHEL (and derivatives). If you are not using one of these distributions please use the provided SOs files. You can also use the [wheel packages](#Python-target) that include the library with the associate bindings.

<!-- ## macOS

macOS has two possible options. First through the available DMG. The second through brew:

``` -->

(Python-target)=
## Python

Use the supplied wheels which will contain the necessary library files as well as the bindings. The Python bindings are very insensitive to version, and optionally require [pylibiio](https://pypi.org/project/pylibiio/) when using the libiio based functions.
